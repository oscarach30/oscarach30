Hello, I'm Oscar Chavez

I'm currently studying Computer Science at Southwestern College. I'm looking to transfer to a 4-year university this coming fall or next Spring.

I have experience with Google Workspace administration, Hostinger Cloud Services, and WordPress.

I'm currently doing non-profit work for proyectoanda.org - a non-profit based in Tijuana, BC that seeks to make Tijuana a more handicapped-accessible city. 
I handle the website (in-progress), the Google Workspace environment, and all the other business technologies that we need.

I'm currently learning Java in school, although I'm already familiar with Web-based languages like HTML and CSS. I'm also beginning to learn about the various JavaScript frameworks like Node.js and React.js
