Hello, I'm Oscar Chavez

I'm currently studying Computer Science.

I have experience with Google Workspace administration, Hostinger Cloud Services, and WordPress.

I'm currently doing non-profit work for proyectoanda.org - a non-profit based in Tijuana, BC that seeks to make Tijuana a more handicapped-accessible city. 
I handle the website (in-progress), the Google Workspace environment, and all the other business technologies that we need.

The website i'm currently working on is proyectoanda.org

I'm currently learning Java in school, although I'm already familiar with Web-based languages like HTML and CSS. I'm also beginning to learn about JavaScript
